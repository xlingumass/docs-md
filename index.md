## Current Research

We're in the process of uploading old research (including resources like papers, scripts, and stimuli) to the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), with the ultimate goal of making our work publically accessible and reproducible. You can find our work on the [Joint Labs](https://osf.io/vr7gu/), [CSL](osf.io/8rcwh/), and [Phonetics Lab](https://osf.io/jbvfr/) projects.
