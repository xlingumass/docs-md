# Cognitive Science of Language Lab

--- 

!["Cognitive Science of Language Lab members."](images/et_lab.jpg)

The [Cognitive Science of Language Lab](osf.io/8rcwh/) studies how readers and listeners recognize the syntactic structure of sentences, and how readers and listeners recognize the meaning of those sentences in context. Specific current projects ask:

1. When, and to what degree, is the Binding Theory applied to constrain the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives? (Currently investigating: English, Romanian, Vietnamese)
2. How do listeners/readers compute verb agreement and pronoun agreement? (Currently investigating: English, Hindi)
3. How do listeners/readers process syntactic ambiguity, adjunct attachment, and filler-gap dependencies? 
4. How do listeners/readers process negation and negative polarity items? (Currently investigating: English, Romanian)

### Lab Basics

#### Ethics training

In order to begin working with human subjects in the lab, all researchers must complete ethics training via the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI). [The link to the CITI Training is here](https://www.umass.edu/research/compliance/human-subjects-irb/training-education-and-outreach/citi-training-human-subjects-research) (take the **Group 2** course). Plan on spending around an hour on the training. Note that you will need to redo the course every five years!

#### Facilities and Equipment

We pursue a 'converging operations' approach, studying the questions above from many different angles, with many distinct methodologies. Common experimental techniques include:

- Eye-tracking-while-reading (EyeLab: N442)
- Self-paced reading (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Speeded acceptability judgment studies (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Recognition/recall tasks (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Untimed survey studies (Web-based)

**EyeLab (N442)**

N442 is the EyeLab. It is used only for running eye-tracking-while-reading experiments. It can run one participant at a time and comes equipped with an [SR Research](http://http://www.sr-research.com) Eyelink 1000 with a tower mount system.

**BehavLab (N447)**

N447 is the BehavLab. This room includes four identically outfitted iMac computers, and is for running any behavioral experiments on Linger/PsychoPy/IbexFarm. It can run four participants at a time.

##### Recruiting participants

We schedule sessions and recruit participants via the [Linguistics SONA](https://umassxling.sona-systems.com/default.aspx). To learn about how to use SONA as an RA, please see the [SONA tutorial](https://osf.io/vr7gu/wiki/UMass+XLing+SONA/).

#### Communication

**Slack** is a messaging system intended to replace emails. Slack has several advantages: first and foremost, it keeps the history of communications related to a project in a single place. Second, it allows brief, rapid communication without the formality of email.

[**Twitter**](http://www.twitter.com) is also highly recommended for fun, for raising your professional visibility, and for plugging in to on-going academic discussion. Follow your favorite psycholinguists; they have lots to say!

##### RMarkdown

For collaborative documents, we prefer [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
