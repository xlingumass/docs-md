## [Phonetics Lab](https://osf.io/jbvfr/)

//placeholder 

Research in the Phonetics Laboratory is focused on three questions:

1.  How do listeners perceive speech sounds?
2.  How is their perception of speech sounds influenced by the contexts in which those sounds occur?
3.  How does the perception of speech sounds influence their phonological patterning?

Presently, our work is concentrated on three more specific versions of these questions:

1.  When does a listener's knowledge that a particular string of sounds is a word influence their perception of an ambiguous sound in that string?
2.  Does the order of two sounds in a string influence how they influence one another's perception?
3.  Does a listener's phonotactic knowledge have second as well as first order effects on the perception of speech sounds?

## [Cognitive Science of Language Lab](osf.io/8rcwh/)

The Cognitive Science of Language lab studies how readers and listeners recognize the syntactic structure of sentences, and how readers and listeners recognize the meaning of those sentences in context. Specific current projects ask:

1. When, and to what degree, is the Binding Theory applied to constrain the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives? (Currently investigating: English, Romanian, Vietnamese)
2. How do listeners/readers compute verb agreement and pronoun agreement? (Currently investigating: English, Hindi)
3. How do listeners/readers process syntactic ambiguity, adjunct attachment, and filler-gap dependencies? 
4. How do listeners/readers process negation and negative polarity items? (Currently investigating: English, Romanian)

### Lab Basics

#### Ethics training

In order to begin working with human subjects in the lab, all researchers must complete ethics training via the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI). [The link to the CITI Training is here](https://www.umass.edu/research/compliance/human-subjects-irb/training-education-and-outreach/citi-training-human-subjects-research) (take the **Group 2** course). Plan on spending around an hour on the training. Note that you will need to redo the course every five years!

#### Facilities and Equipment

We pursue a 'converging operations' approach, studying the questions above from many different angles, with many distinct methodologies. Common experimental techniques include:

- Eye-tracking-while-reading (EyeLab: N442)
- Self-paced reading (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Speeded acceptability judgment studies (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Recognition/recall tasks (BehavLab: N447; Web-based)
- Untimed survey studies (Web-based)

**EyeLab (N442)**

N442 is the EyeLab. It is used only for running eye-tracking-while-reading experiments. It can run one participant at a time and comes equipped with an [SR Research](http://http://www.sr-research.com) Eyelink 1000 with a tower mount system.

**BehavLab (N447)**

N447 is the BehavLab. This room includes four identically outfitted iMac computers, and is for running any behavioral experiments on Linger/PsychoPy/IbexFarm. It can run four participants at a time.

##### Recruiting participants

We schedule sessions and recruit participants via the [Linguistics SONA](https://umassxling.sona-systems.com/default.aspx). To learn about how to use SONA as an RA, please see the [SONA tutorial](https://osf.io/vr7gu/wiki/UMass%20XLing%20SONA/).

#### Communication

**Slack** is a messaging system intended to replace emails. Slack has several advantages: first and foremost, it keeps the history of communications related to a project in a single place. Second, it allows brief, rapid communication without the formality of email.

[**Twitter**](http://www.twitter.com) is also highly recommended for fun, for raising your professional visibility, and for plugging in to on-going academic discussion. Follow your favorite psycholinguists; they have lots to say!

##### RMarkdown

For collaborative documents, we prefer [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
