<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>In this
research, Brian Dillon, of the University of Massachusetts
Amherst, is investigating the processes involved in the comprehension of
English sentences. The information collected in this study will be used in the preparation
of papers for presentation in international conferences and journals on
language. You are eligible to participate in this study because you are a
native speaker of English, over 18 years of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'><u>Procedures<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'>In this study, you will first be asked a few questions about your
language background, and then you will be asked to judge English sentences.
You will be asked questions about the sentences, such as how natural they seem, or what you take to be the most likely meaning of the sentences. The entire
process should take about 15-20 minutes, if you work efficiently. Upon
completion, you will be compensated with $5 USD, provided that your responses
indicate that you did read the dialogs and questions carefully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:14.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:
exactly'>There are no known risks involved in this experimental procedure. However, with any online research there is a slight risk of a breach of confidentiality. To guard against this possibility, we will not collect any uniquely identifying information (such as your MTurk worker ID) on the servers where our data is collected. </p>
